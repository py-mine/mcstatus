Mcstatus provides an API and command line script to fetch publicly available data from Minecraft servers. Specifically, mcstatus retrieves data by using these protocols: [Server List Ping](https://wiki.vg/Server_List_Ping) and [Query](https://wiki.vg/Query). Because of mcstatus, you do not need to fully understand those protocols and can instead skip straight to retrieving minecraft server data quickly in your own programs.

## Installation

Mcstatus is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mcstatus/), and can be installed trivially with:

```bash
python3 -m pip install mcstatus
```

## Usage

### Python API

#### Java Edition

```python
from mcstatus import JavaServer

# You can pass the same address you'd enter into the address field in minecraft into the 'lookup' function
# If you know the host and port, you may skip this and use JavaServer("example.org", 1234)
server = JavaServer.lookup("example.org:1234")

# 'status' is supported by all Minecraft servers that are version 1.7 or higher.
# Don't expect the player list to always be complete, because many servers run
# plugins that hide this information or limit the number of players returned or even
# alter this list to contain fake players for purposes of having a custom message here.
status = server.status()
print(f"The server has {status.players.online} player(s) online and replied in {status.latency} ms")

# 'ping' is supported by all Minecraft servers that are version 1.7 or higher.
# It is included in a 'status' call, but is also exposed separate if you do not require the additional info.
latency = server.ping()
print(f"The server replied in {latency} ms")

# 'query' has to be enabled in a server's server.properties file!
# It may give more information than a ping, such as a full player list or mod information.
query = server.query()
print(f"The server has the following players online: {', '.join(query.players.names)}")
```

#### Bedrock Edition

```python
from mcstatus import BedrockServer

# You can pass the same address you'd enter into the address field in minecraft into the 'lookup' function
# If you know the host and port, you may skip this and use BedrockServer("example.org", 19132)
server = BedrockServer.lookup("example.org:19132")

# 'status' is the only feature that is supported by Bedrock at this time.
# In this case status includes players.online, latency, motd, map, gamemode, and players.max. (ex: status.gamemode)
status = server.status()
print(f"The server has {status.players.online} players online and replied in {status.latency} ms")
```

### Command Line Interface

This only works with Java servers; Bedrock is not yet supported. Use `mcstatus -h` to see helpful information on how to use this script.
